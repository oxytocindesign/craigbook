<h2 class="postingtitle">Programmer needed to develop tool for website. HTML5 flex? (Raleigh nc)</h2>

<section class="userbody">

	

	
	<section id="postingbody">
		 I'm looking for a programmer to make a tool for one of my websites. I am a graphic artist and I have a client who wants a tool for his website described below. I've attached a layout of how I want it to look and it explains a lot. I've attached an image of the initial layout. The purpose of this website is to sell field stands and banners for marching bands. I've also attached some images for reference. It's also important that I can be in control of the graphic elements and the user interface. It should look like the attached images and I can provide individual graphic files as needed or layered photoshop file of this artwork. YOU ARE NOT being asked to develop the website, that is my job. I've only attached the website layout image for your better s of the scope of the project. Your job would be to develop the tool described below.<br>
<br>
THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW:  <br>
1. IT IS IMPORTANT that the tool user interface looks almost EXACTLY like the images you can download here: <a href="https://www.yousendit.com/download/UW15Rm8zQVN0d0dFQk1UQw" rel="nofollow">https://www.yousendit.com/download/UW15Rm8zQVN0d0dFQk1UQw</a><br>
<br>
I can provide all graphics in whatever format you need and you should consult me on all graphics. <br>
2. The purpose of the website where this tool will be is to sell digitally printed banners, and banner stands for marching bands. <br>
3. The attached images will show that the "tools" will slide out and in like an accordion when clicked. <br>
4. I will provide you with field arrangment images, prop shapes, fabric swatches, and stock selection of artwork.<br>
5. There needs to be a back-end for me to edit the content of this tool. The more the better, I dare say everything if possible. Maybe an .xml loaded something would suffice. I am not a complete incompetent when it comes to coding, but I no expert by any means. <br>
6. The user needs to be able to click and drop the prop stands onto the field. Then be able to move the prop stand around on the field. (prop is another word for banner) <br>
7. The user needs to then be able to drag and drop a fabric swatch onto the prop and it will fill the square. The user can fill it with EITHER a fabric OR their artwork OR something from the selection of stock artwork. NOT all, they should not appear to overlay. <br>
8. I want the ability to drag and drop upload OR the user could click "choose file" <br>
9. I would prefer that this program should be written in a language that is ipad friendly. <br>
10. Notice there is a scroll bar to the right of each section. That needs to work! There is going to be an extensive list of fabrics and stock artwork, that we will need to add and subtract from in the future. <br>
11. The perspective of the user's uploaded artwork should match the example I've provided on the field. <br>
12. The field needs zoom capabilites. <br>
13. Once the user drags and drops their artwork on a prop, they need to able to resize it to fit the space. <br>
14. Notice there are three categories of fabrics to choose from. The list should repopulate based on their selection.  <br>
Candidates who answer the below questions will be considered more seriously:  <br>
What language of programming do you think this will take? How long will it take to develop? <br>
What is your estimate (price range)? <br>
Will you guarantee satisfaction? <br>
Do you have any samples of tools you have developed with similar functions? If so, can you show me?<br>
<br>
Thank you.
