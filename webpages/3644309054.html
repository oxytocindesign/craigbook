Sr. IS Network Engineer -- O'hare Airport AREA.<br>
<br>
Plan, design, engineer, develop, implement, and troubleshoot infrastructure technologies on the IS network.  Provide subject matter expertise around specific technologies.  Provide project management for the deployment of infrastructure projects.  Act as vendor interface for support of applications and technologies.  Evaluate and implement new technologies, policies, and procedures for business network operations.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
KEYS<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Skills:    What are the top technical skills someone needs to be successful in this role?  (3 or more)  List and years of experience needed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <br>
<br>
                1) Layer 2 & 3 routing and switching experience is a must for this role.  Depends on the team to determine design and architecture.  5-7 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <br>
<br>
                2) Firewall experience and understanding from a tier 1 service level minimum meaning someone who understands more than just policy.  They need to be able to support the firewall hardware.  This group owns how they implement the policy.  The policies are developed by the Security Delivery team              <br>
<br>
                                <br>
<br>
                3) VoIP - Walberto was the VoIP guy on the team so there is a gap from a design, implement and test perspective.  Exposure to QOS and an under-standing of the basics is what they are targeting.                                              <br>
<br>
                                                                                                                                                                                <br>
<br>
                4) Load Balancing experience - From a tier 1 service level minimum perspective.  Finding someone who has good experience with load balancing technology would be great but if they have a good base of exposure they are willing to train them up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <br>
<br>
This is a small team that offers a lot of support.  If a candidate shows good instincts, they will go the extra mile and train them on the technology.                                                              <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The manager is not hung up on degrees or certifications.  He is looking for Enterprise environment experience and understanding networks from a  base.  Someone who has a drive to pick things up and a desire to learn new things is the key.  Someone who will do this proactively is a target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <br>
<br>
What are the top non-technical skills someone needs to be successful in this role?  List and years of experience needed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <br>
<br>
                1) A good people person and work with a team.  If it's 3am and there is an issue - have to be able to communicate effectively up.                                                                                                                                                                                   <br>
<br>
                2) Able to work independently and as a team.                                                                                                                                                                                    <br>
<br>
                3) Flexibility - key aspect in an operations role.  Don't have the luxury of knowing when things are going to go down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <br>
<br>
                4) Be able to process documentation.                                                                                                                    <br>
<br>
                                                                                <br>
<br>
                Are there any skills that are viewed as nice to have?  If they have experience working on Avaya VoIP equipment running on a Cisco network that would be a plus but again, looking for base knowledge.  Will train people to work on specifics if they have the concepts down.             <br>
