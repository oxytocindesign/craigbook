		CRM Customization Specialist (Manchester, NH= 60 minutes north of Boston)<br>
 I was recently hired to be the regional manager for a specialty contracting company and the systems that the existing shop has are pretty archaic. I have 10+ years of experience using shrink-wrap CRM to successfully manage business activities in the past. This situation is a lot more exiting because it will only take a short time to get my region organized and after that- the CEO wants me to open another region and you will help me do that too (probably in Worcester, MA).  <br>
<br>
Here's where it gets interesting.<br>
For now, we are going to get the CRM moving with some activity series, data entry (maybe migration), custom forms, SOP's, etc. I have full disgression over a modest budget to get my current region streamlined.  In a few months I will be buying a few seats worth of an enterprise/workflow management software to help us manage lots more than the contacts.  Product B has CRM module as well, and it holds together evertyhing else too.  *You will be helping me with all of this.<br>
<br>
 If you are between projects (or jobs) and you would like to help me customize and implement these systems, I would like to talk to you.<br>
 I do have a modest budget for this, and I do not expect you to work for free.<br>
 I would like to deal with one consultant that will really sink his/her teeth into this projects and be a partner through the ups & downs because you and I will be doing this together.  I have a crystal-clear vision of how this will work and I can draw it on a whiteboard, right down to the digital forms that we will need to create.  I also have the cred with my company to sit workers down and plot their routines out in an effort to make the workflow fit together efficiently.  <br>
<br>
 The ultimate person will have experience 5+ years customizing CRM software (maybe at a VAR) to fit small businesses. You should have business experience yourself and understand how to organize workflow on a project to reach objectives. Also, I don't mind delegating some parts of the project to Odesk (which I do from time to time).<br>
 After we get this region all wired up, then we will do an assessment & customize & install the system in the main offices in Connecticut.<br>
 I need a partner for this and this project s very real.<br>
 Please no flakes, nuts, or turkeys. <br>
<br>
*I have been in the commercial construction vertical for a while and I have noticed that VERY FEW businesses are modernized, even the successfull ones.  It's not lost on me that if we create something powerful for my CEO now, then we can scale/ customize our package to fit other industries where I know a lot of players.  I already know how to sell to those guys.  I could sell them the vision of a paperless office + automated workflow= efficiency.  We could do that on our own.  Food for though.<br>
