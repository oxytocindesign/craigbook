<h2 class="postingtitle">Website and Maintenance (Meridian (Online))</h2>

<section class="userbody">

	

	
	<section id="postingbody">
		I'm looking for someone to build and maintain a website for me. I'm starting a new business.<br>
<br>
The way this works.<br>
<br>
Position requirement: The ability to create and maintain a website that incorporates sales, bank accounts, individual customer profiles, and connects to other writer-based websites, such as Writer's Market, Poetry.com, and the like. I'm looking for someone willing to help me build this business from the ground up, and I'll readily provide references to whichever employer they move on to (should they decide to move on at all). <br>
<br>
Position Pay: 10-15% of the business' profits. Whether that ends up being 100 a month, or 10,000. Realistically, the number (based on 100 customers) would be 4500 a month, and so 450 for YOU. That should go up rather quickly over the following months as the customer base is built up. At 1000 customers, you'd be making roughly 4500 a month just maintaining the website and helping to promote it on various forums. (All in all, once we get UP and running, we'll have steady in-come and our work will be easier and at a slower pace).<br>
<br>
Starting: As soon as hired.<br>
<br>
What I'm looking for in an employee: I'm looking for someone willing to help me build this business from the ground up, and I'll readily provide references to whichever employer they move on to (should they decide to move on at all). This person needs to be dedicated, talented, and have a passion for building something out of nothing. They also need to understand that the rewards are based, in large part, upon what they're willing to put into the business, id est, dedication, effort, etc. I expect to have this business built, up and running, and fully functional within a month after we begin. I need someone that can work that pace. As the qualified employee knows, work will become much easier, and a bit slower, once the initial race is done.<br>
<br>
Application process: E-mail me by responding to this ads address., leaving your name, number, and what YOU perceive to be your best qualifications and/or experience. We'll talk a bit about it, see if it's a good fit for you. If we're seeing eye to eye, then you'll need to come to Meridian, ID for an in-person interview, at which point you'll sign a nondisclosure agreement, and we'll go into detail about the website, business, etc. You're only required the one trip to see me in person. After that you can work from home, or wherever you prefer.
