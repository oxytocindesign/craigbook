<h2 class="postingtitle">More and More Cheapo IT Crooks on here (Houston)</h2>

<section class="userbody">

	

	
	<section id="postingbody">
		I've been watching with both sadness and great amusement a variety of disgruntled burnt out people "outing" a lot of these cheap, backstabbing IT companies that are nothing but liars, f1akes and slave drivers. When did it get so bad? The few good honest ones I've worked with are all gone, drove out by the half price hacks and mismanaged services crooks. So many seriously BROKEN networks all over town..<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, the clients play a roll too. just look at some of the ads here for so-called "interns" where they want someone with years of server experience AND to build their website too? Funny they never mention the part that makes it an actual internship: the training. Likewise, "perfect for students" is yet another back door way of saying they want college experience on student wages. I love it when a client asks me why their network is totally messed up and then I find out they were paying someone 100 bucks an hour or less to work on their "server' which is usually a pathetic whitebox desktop with extra ram and sata drives. <br>
<br>
And is there anything more dishonest and horrible than this stupid "managed services" scheme? I attended some of those slick pitches by the usual scoundrals (connectwise, xenith, labtech) and they fully lay out the intent of not building a business, but building a portfolio of clients for the SOLE purpose of selling out to a bigger company. And what a great profit model: We charge the client a fixed fee every month, and the less actual work we do for them the more money we make... Wow. Why hasn't someone done a news story on this. Its fundamentally dishonest. All the promises of "24x7 monitoring" and such are pure BS and they know it.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story is thus: The next time some company tries to chew you down on rate or salary, tell them you KNOW better, and by better you know what the alternative is. That so few of these companies have figured out what a shortsighted business goal being the lowest price alternative is, is really astonishing in an industry that's supposed to be full of smart people. Funny how all I see is stupidity, or smart people whose intelligence is clouded by GREED.
